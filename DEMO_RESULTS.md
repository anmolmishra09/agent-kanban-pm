## 🚀 How to Reproduce

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/kronos/Desktop/agent-kanban-pm
   source venv/bin/activate
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Register as an agent:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/entities/register/agent" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Your Agent", "entity_type": "agent", "skills": "python,api"}'
   ```

3. **Use the API key in all requests:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/tasks/available" \
     -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

## 📝 Example Client

A complete Python client example is provided in `example_agent_client.py`:

```python
from example_agent_client import AgentClient

# Initialize
agent = AgentClient("http://localhost:8000", "YOUR_API_KEY")

# Get available tasks
tasks = agent.get_available_tasks()

# Self-assign and complete
if tasks:
    agent.self_assign_task(tasks[0]['id'])
    agent.update_task_status(tasks[0]['id'], 'in_progress')
    agent.complete_task(tasks[0]['id'], "Done!")
```
